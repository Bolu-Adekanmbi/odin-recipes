# odin-recipes

The purpose of this project is to create a barebones website that encapuslates everything I've learned so far in the Odin Project's Foundations Module.

Eventually, I home to come back once I've had a better understanding of web development to make something even cooler and more exciting.

Till then, I will enjoy the journey one step at a time.
