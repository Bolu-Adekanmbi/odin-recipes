        <p>These chicken Caesar smashed tacos are easy to make with a Caesar salad kit, some ground chicken, and flour tortillas.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
            <li>6 (6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Greek seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 package Caesar salad mix</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread ground chicken evenly in a very thin layer over each tortilla, spreading the meat all the way to the edges. Sprinkle with Greek seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Chop lettuce (if pieces are large) into smaller pieces. Toss with included packets of dressing and cheese. Slightly crush croutons included in salad mix and set aside. </li>
            <li>Heat a griddle or large nonstick skillet on medium-high heat. Spread half of the olive oil over the hot surface.  Working in 2 batches, place prepared tortillas, meat side down on griddle and cook, undisturbed, until meat is browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Flip, and cook 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining tacos. </li>
            <li>Top tacos evenly with Caesar salad and sprinkle with crushed croutons. Fold in half and serve immediately.</li>
